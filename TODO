Things to do:

  * The main file should be split into several.  At the very least,
    the GUI should be in a separate file.  There might be other
    independent modules to identify. 

  * Include commands for changing the font size from the application
    command line. 

  * Implement automatic line wrapping in order to avoid having to
    modify the source text according to the font size. 

  * Add more texts. (Beware of copyright issues).

  * Fix existing entries in, and add new entries to the main
    dictionary.

  * Write documentation.
